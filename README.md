### Feature 3


<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->

## Concept Process

Before beginnig to write the code in my project i went over to pinterest and went through some of the best looking websites regarding my chosen data set and with regards to meeeting the briefs requirements.

### Ideation


### Custom UI

The custom UI I made use of was provided by Coinponent, the UI sits at the top of my web application and provides the user with market movement and updates surronding eh bitcoin ecosystem 

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## Development Process

Users are able to cycle through various currencies on the comparison and timeline page and display data about the various object properties all with help of the Coinlore API.

### Implementation Process

<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

- Utilized React `Charts.JS` dependency for Data visualization
- Implemented Routing with `React-Router v6`.
- API End Point: https://api.coinlore.net/api/global/
- Ticker and plugins were achieved with the help of: https://coinponent.com/crypto-converter-widget
- ETC.

#### Highlights

<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->

- The highlight for me was getting familiar with JSX and the other react syntax, it proved to be challenging but extremely
  worthwhile when everything came together.
- I really enjoyed working with Chart js even though it proved to be an issue throughout, i really enjoyed the data visualization aspect.

#### Challenges

<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->

- The biggest challenge for me was the dynamic population of data into the Charts, however I learnt quickly and was able to overcome
  the issues.
- There were a large amount of bugs that kept me awake most nights, mainly due to the syntax in React.

#### Above And Beyond

Going above and beyond the brief

<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->

- I explored the use of Material UI as a way to implement a cleaner and more visually appealing front end .
- Through the use of Coinponent I implemented a coin ticker bar.
- Explain your understanding and execution of above skill.

### Future Implementation

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- In the future i would like to get my timeline page fully functioning as i was not quite able to complete it due to time restrictions
- I would like to actually implement a way for users to access the blockchain (I'm aiming high) through my website and possibly even
  make transactions, who knows :).

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
